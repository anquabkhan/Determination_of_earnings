Project Overview:
1) Achieved prelimnary data exploration by checking for missing and duplicate values, checking the decriptive statistics and visualizing the features of the dataset
2) Achieved data by cleaning duplicate and missing values
3) Implemented simple linear regression and Multivariabe regression on the dataset
4) Evaluated the coefficients of both models
5) Analyzed and estimated values and regression residuals for both models
6) Used the models to make predictions
